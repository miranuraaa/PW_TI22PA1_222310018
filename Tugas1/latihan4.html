<h1>The 10 Most Popular Programming Languages 
    to Learn in 2022</h1>
<p> There’s no question that software programming is a hot career right now. The <span style="color: red;">U.S. 
Bureau of Labor Statistics</span> projects 21 percent growth for programming jobs from 
    2018 to 2028, which is more than four times the average for all occupations. What’s 
    more, the median annual pay for a software programmer is about $106,000, which 
    is nearly three times the median pay for all U.S. workers.</p>
<p> Not all programming jobs are the same, however. Different roles, companies, 
    and types of software require knowing and understanding different 
    programming languages—and it’s often beneficial to know multiple 
    languages. Trying to break into the field of software programming can be a 
    daunting experience, especially for professionals with no prior programming 
    experience.</p>
<p> The <a href="https://www.example.com/align-program">Master of Science in Computer Science Align program</a> at Northeastern 
    University is specifically designed for students who want to transition into 
    computer science from another field of study.</p>
<p> <i>“Our aim is to transport students from a variety of different backgrounds 
    and have them come out as software engineers,”</i> says Ian Gorton, PhD and 
    director of the graduate computer science programs at Northeastern 
    University—Seattle. <i>“We focus on math, programming, and a variety of
    computer science and engineering concepts.”</i></p>
    <p class="last">Whether you’re new to programming or looking to brush up on your skills, it 
        helps to know which languages are in high demand. Here are 10 of the most 
        popular programming languages of 2020 based on the number of job postings 
        listed on job search sites Indeed, the average annual salary for those jobs, and 
        factors such as ease of use and potential for growth.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Web-based</b> startups are more likely to be programming in <b>Python</b> and 
                <b>JavaScript</b>.</li>
            <li>Larger companies tend to develop their internal software applications 
                using <b>C#</b> or Java and their <b>Web applications using PHP</b>.</li>
            <li>Programs for data <i>analytics typically</i> use the <b>R</b> and <b>MATLAB</b>
                programming languages.</li>
            <li><i><u>Embedded devices</u></i>, such as those in the automotive and healthcare 
                industries, run software written in <b>C, C++, or Rust</b>.</li>
            <li>Applications that run on the cloud are increasingly written in <b>Go or 
                Scala</b>.</li>
            <li><b>Mobile applications</b> are increasingly written in Swift or Kotlin.</li>
